Had meeting to clarify assumptions about the application. Product owner discussed vision on how the application would work. 

Had more meetings with the team to discuss how the technology stack works and how all of the starter code interacts with each other. 

This week we got the ball rolling with our sprint, implemented most of the jira tickets in the lead up to the project demo in week 5. 

For me personally, I worked on the admin http routes:

This includes creating users, getting all users, getting users by username, updating user details and deleting users. 

After writing this, testing was also neccessary to ensure the code works. This involves first testng the code through Docker, MongoDB and Postman. Then after those manual tests are working, pytest is used to test using code.
